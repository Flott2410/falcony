The federal states are responsible for the concrete implementation of the measures. For travellers arriving from a country that is classified as a risk area according to the Robert Koch Institute website, a mandatory 14-day quarantine applies in almost all federal states. Risk areas are those with a 7-day incidence greater than 50 cases/100,000 inhabitants. The federal states issue the quarantine obligation under their own responsibility. This measure can only be dispensed with if travellers have a medical certificate that confirms that there is no evidence of an infection with the SARSCoV-2 coronavirus. The medical certificate must come from a member state of the European Union or another state published by the Robert Koch Institute and must not be older than 48 hours upon arrival.
